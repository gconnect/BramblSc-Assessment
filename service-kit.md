# Overview of Service Kit

This section provides a decent introduction to the Service Kit, but it could be significantly improved for clarity, developer accessibility, and completeness. Below are the key suggestions for improvement:

---

### **1. Improve Structure and Organization**
#### *Problem:*
The section lacks clear organization and flow, making it harder to follow for new readers. Terms are introduced without proper context, and the relationship between different components (e.g., Wallet Vault, Wallet State) could be clarified further.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- **Add Subheadings and a Table of Contents**  
  A Table of Contents at the beginning will allow users to jump to specific sections.  
  Example structure:
  ```
  1. Introduction
  2. Wallet Overview
      2.1. Wallet Vault
      2.2. Wallet State
  3. Fellowship Storage
  4. Template Storage
  5. Wallet State Details
  ```
  Adding a table of contents makes navigation easier, especially for larger sections.

### **2. Clarify Terminology and Core Concepts**
#### *Problem:*  
Some terms like **Fellowship**, **Templates**, **HD Wallet**, and **Wallet Vault** are used without adequate explanation. This could confuse developers who are new to the SDK or unfamiliar with these concepts.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- **Provide Definitions** for core terms such as:
  - **Fellowship**: What exactly is a fellowship in the context of this SDK? Why is it necessary?  
    Example:  
    > "A fellowship is a group of participants associated with a wallet. It organizes interactions and templates used for various operations within the wallet."
  - **HD Wallet**: Briefly explain hierarchical deterministic wallets for those unfamiliar with the term.  
    Example:  
    > "An HD Wallet is a type of wallet that can generate a tree of key pairs from a single seed, simplifying wallet management."
  - **Templates**: Offer clarity on what they represent in the system (e.g., contracts or interactions).  
    Example:  
    > "Templates are reusable contract scripts defining rules for interactions between fellowships and assets."
  
- **Explain the Need for the Wallet Vault and State**  
  Clarify why the wallet has two parts and how they interact:
  - *Example*: "The Wallet Vault stores the encrypted master key, while the Wallet State tracks wallet interactions such as fellowships and templates, ensuring the wallet maintains its correct state as interactions occur."

---

### **3. Simplify the Language and Improve Readability**
#### *Problem:*  
The language used is a bit too technical and assumes a high level of familiarity with the SDK. This makes the documentation harder to understand for beginners.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- **Simplify sentences and technical jargon.** Use shorter, clearer sentences to explain complex concepts.
  Example revision for **Default Fellowship Storage**:
  > "The fellowship storage uses a database table to manage fellowships in the wallet. Each fellowship has a unique identifier and an index within the HD wallet."
  
- **Add Examples Where Appropriate:**  
  For instance, in the "Default Fellowship Storage" section, show a real-world use case where a user creates or modifies fellowships. Example:  
  ```scala
  // Example: Adding a new fellowship
  val newFellowship = Fellowship("newFellow", 3)
  wallet.addFellowship(newFellowship)
  ```

---

### **4. Add Code Snippets for Key Functionality**
#### *Problem:*  
There is a lack of **real-world code examples** demonstrating how to work with the Service Kitâ€™s APIs. While SQL schemas are provided, code that ties it to the SDK is missing.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- **Include code snippets that demonstrate interacting with the Wallet, Fellowships, and Templates.** For example:
  - *Example code for accessing the wallet vault*:
    ```scala
    val vault = WalletKeyApiAlgebra.getVault(walletId)
    // Encrypt the master key
    vault.encryptMasterKey(password)
    ```
  - *Example for managing fellowship state*:
    ```scala
    val fellowship = FellowshipStorageAlgebra.getFellowship("self")
    println(s"Fellowship Name: ${fellowship.name}")
    ```

---

### **5. Highlight Security Considerations**
#### *Problem:*  
No mention of security considerations around handling the Wallet Vault, even though it involves encryption and private key storage.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- Add a **Security Considerations** section to highlight:
  - The importance of **securing the master key**.
  - Best practices for **managing wallet states** and **encrypting vaults**.
  - Mention any **SDK-provided encryption methods** or **best practices** (e.g., always back up your vault).
  
  Example revision for **Wallet Vault**:
  > "The wallet vault stores the encrypted master key, and it is crucial to ensure this file is secured properly. The Brambl SDK offers tools to encrypt the master key, and developers should ensure that sensitive data, such as the vault file, is stored securely and backed up regularly."

---

### **6. Provide Context for SQL Schemas**
#### *Problem:*  
SQL schemas are provided without enough explanation of how they tie into the overall system. This can be overwhelming for users who are not familiar with database operations.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- **Explain the purpose of each schema and its importance in the context of the Service Kit.**  
  Example:
  - The **fellowship schema** keeps track of all fellowships associated with the wallet, allowing the system to manage participants efficiently.  
  Add context to the schemas, like why indexing certain columns is necessary or how to extend these tables.

---

### **7. Add Missing Use Cases**
#### *Problem:*  
There is a lack of practical, high-level use cases that describe how a developer would implement common operations, like creating a wallet, adding fellowships, or performing transactions.

#### *Suggested Improvement:*
- Provide **high-level use cases** or **scenarios** that describe how a developer can:
  - Set up the wallet
  - Add fellowships
  - Store state changes (e.g., interaction or transaction states)  
  These should be linked to code snippets and SQL schemas.
