# Terminologies

Some of the terminologies in the documentation assume prior knowledge, which may make it harder for new developers to follow. Providing clearer definitions will improve accessibility. Below are key terms that require further explanation:  

### Solution
- **[Wallet](https://topl.github.io/BramblSc/docs/current/reference/wallets/):**  
  A brief definition of what a wallet is, along with its purpose in the context of the SDK, should be included. Additionally, a link to a more detailed explanation should be provided.  

- **[RPC (Remote Procedure Call)](https://topl.github.io/BramblSc/docs/current/reference/rpc):**  
  The full form of RPC should be explicitly mentioned, and a simple explanation of its role in communicating between applications or services should be added.  

- **Glossary Section:**  
  Introducing a dedicated Terminologies/Glossary section will allow users to quickly look up special keywords or domain-specific terms. This section will help both experienced developers and newcomers better understand the content without needing external research.  

These improvements will ensure the documentation is beginner-friendly while still catering to more advanced developers.
