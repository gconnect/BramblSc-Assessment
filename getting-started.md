# Getting Started
The Getting Started section serves as the entry point for the documentation. It should provide developers with a clear overview of the SDK and ensure they have the necessary context to integrate it easily. However, the current section falls short in the following ways:

## Problem  
- Itâ€™s unclear whether **Scala knowledge** is required to use the SDK.
- There is no mention of **setup requirements** or **system prerequisites**.
- The **installation and quick start instructions** lack clarity and depth, making it harder for developers to onboard quickly.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. **Add a Table of Contents**  
   - Introduce a **structured layout** with internal links for easy navigation to subsections (e.g., Introduction, Prerequisites, Installation, Quick Start). 

### 2. **Provide a Clear Introduction**  
   - Include a **brief introduction** to explain what the Brambl SDK is, its purpose, and key features. This will help developers understand when and why they should use it.

### 3. **Add Prerequisites Section**  
   - Outline any **necessary knowledge or tools**, such as:  
     - Basic knowledge of Scala (if applicable).  
     - Familiarity with Maven or SBT for dependency management.  

### 4. **System Requirements**  
   - Specify any **system dependencies or requirements**, such as:  
     - **JDK version** compatibility (e.g., JDK 8 or JDK 11).  
     - Supported **Scala versions** (2.13).  
     - Any other **operating system or library dependencies**.  

### 5. **Enhance Installation Guide**  
   - Provide **step-by-step installation instructions** that walk developers through:  
     - Adding dependencies in `build.sbt`.  
     - Configuring any necessary environment variables, if applicable.

### 6. **Expand the Quick Start Section with Code Samples**  
   - Offer **more comprehensive code snippets**, such as:
     - Initializing the SDK.
     - Creating a basic wallet using `ServiceKit`.  
     - A minimal "Hello World" integration example.
