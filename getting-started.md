# Getting Started
The Getting Started section serves as the entry point for the documentation. It should provide developers with a clear overview of the SDK and ensure they have the necessary context to integrate it easily. However, the current section falls short in the following ways:

## Problem  
- Itâ€™s unclear whether **Scala knowledge** is required to use the SDK.
- The documentation does not clearly specify what types of applications or dApps (e.g., web, mobile, or both) can be built using the SDK, leaving developers uncertain about its intended use cases.
- There is no mention of setup requirements or system prerequisites.
- The installation and quick start instructions lack clarity and depth, making it harder for developers to onboard quickly.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. **Add a Table of Contents**  
   - Introduce a **structured layout** with internal links for easy navigation to subsections (e.g., Introduction, Prerequisites, Installation, Quick Start). 

### 2. **Provide a Clear Introduction**  
   - Include a **brief introduction** to explain what the Brambl SDK is, its purpose, and key features. This will help developers understand when and why they should use it.

### 3. **Add Prerequisites Section**  
   - Outline any **necessary knowledge or tools**, such as:  
     - Basic knowledge of Scala (if applicable).  
     - Familiarity with Maven or SBT for dependency management.  

### 4. **System Requirements**  
   - Specify any **system dependencies or requirements**, such as:  
     - **JDK version** compatibility (e.g., JDK 8 or JDK 11).  
     - Supported **Scala versions** (2.13).  
     - Any other **operating system or library dependencies**.  

### 5. **Enhance Installation Guide**  
   - Provide **step-by-step installation instructions** that walk developers through:  
     - Adding dependencies in `build.sbt`.  
     - Configuring any necessary environment variables, if applicable.
    
### 6. Add a Use Case Overview Section 
- Introduce a new subsection that explicitly outlines the **types of applications** the SDK supports. Example:

     **Use Case Overview:**  
     - **Web Applications:** The SDK can be integrated into backend services or browser-based dApps using frameworks such as Play or Akka HTTP.  
     - **Mobile Applications:** While the SDK is built for Scala, it can be used with mobile backends (e.g., Android or iOS) through API integrations. Developers may expose SDK functions via REST APIs for mobile clients.  
     - **Hybrid Solutions:** The SDK is suitable for both web and mobile setups, especially where shared logic (e.g., wallet management) is required across platforms.

 **Provide Integration Examples**  
   - Add simple **example flows** or architecture diagrams demonstrating how the SDK can fit into web and mobile ecosystems.

 **Clarify Platform Requirements**  
   - If direct mobile support is limited, include **workarounds** (e.g., backend server integration) to show developers how to extend the SDK's functionality to mobile apps.

This will help developers understand **where and how** the SDK can be used, reducing uncertainty and enhancing its usability across different application types.

### 7. **Expand the Quick Start Section with Code Samples**  
   - Offer **more comprehensive code snippets**, such as:
     - Initializing the SDK.
     - Creating a basic wallet using `ServiceKit`.  
     - A minimal "Hello World" integration example.
