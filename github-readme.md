## 1.1 README.md Enhancements
### Problem:
The current [README](https://github.com/Topl/BramblSc) is minimal and lacks detailed information on setup, usage, and project structure. This can be challenging for developers, especially newcomers, to navigate the repository.

### Suggested Improvements
#### Introduction Section
The introduction section should briefly summarize what Brambl SDK does, its primary use cases, and who can benefit from it.

#### Example

The Brambl SDK is designed to simplify interaction with Toplâ€™s blockchain, providing cryptographic utilities and tools to build decentralized applications. This SDK powers use cases like asset issuance, transaction monitoring, and key management.

#### Setup Installation Guide:
Quick setup installation steps should be added.

- Required tools e.g., Java, Scala, SBT
- OS-specific setup instructions

#### Note
Java/Scala version XXX will be required.

#### Example
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/topl/brambl-sc.git
cd brambl-sc

# Install dependencies
sbt update

# Run tests
sbt test
```

## Overview of Each Artifacts

### brambl-sdks
The brambl-sdks are a collection of software development kits that allow developers to interact with the Network. There are currently SDKs for the following languages:

- Scala (BramblSc)
- Dart (BramblDart)
For the above SDK it will be great to have a link to the SDK.
  
### crypto
The crypto module provides cryptographic functions like signature verification. Here is a detail guide to learn more about the [Crypto]() artifact.

### service-kit
The service kit is an implementation of several APIs defined in the brambl-sdk. Here is a reference documentation to learn more about [service-kit](https://topl.github.io/BramblSc/docs/current/service-kit/big-picture).

### quivr4s
A brief explanation on what this is about and how it is used in the SDK.

### 1.2 Usage Examples
#### Problem:
The README doesn't contain code examples to show how the SDK can be used. Examples are essential for developers to quickly get started without diving deep into the codebase.

#### Suggested Improvements:
A Getting Started Example Code is required to show how to use brambl-sdk.

##### Creating a Transaction

```scala
import co.topl.brambl.Transaction

val tx = Transaction.create(sender = "address1", receiver = "address2", amount = 100)
println(s"Transaction: $tx")
```

##### Interacting with service-kit
Example code for interacting with service kit.

## Project Structure
### Problem
There is currently no proper definition of the project structure

### Solution
A detail breakdown of the project or repository structure will help enhance the documentation and make navigation easy for developers. This could be done using illustrative or architectural diagrams.

## 1.4 Contribution Guidelines
### Problem:
There's no mention of how external contributors can contribute to the project.

## Suggested Improvements
Add a "Contributing" section explaining;
- Code style guidelines link to contributing guide.
- How to submit pull requests.
- Running tests before submission.
