# Documentation Improvements for BramblSc

## Sections Selected for Improvement:
- README.md
- Usage Examples
- Troubleshooting and Documentation Navigation


## Reason for Selection:
The README.md is the first interaction point for developers. Improving it ensures better onboarding for both new and experienced users.
Usage examples reduce friction for developers by showing how to use the library directly.

Troubleshooting helps developers resolve common issues, improving their overall experience.

## Summary of Changes:
### README.md:
- Added a detailed introduction and installation guide.
- Provided an overview of key artifacts.

### Usage Examples:
- Added a sample transaction creation example to the README.
- Suggested linking to unit tests for reference.

### Troubleshooting:
- Proposed adding common issues (e.g., Scala version conflicts) to save developers time.

## Challenges Faced:
It was unclear how some artifacts (e.g., service-kit) are intended to be used. I suggested linking to subdirectories or test files for better understanding.
I couldnâ€™t find clear usage examples for all artifacts, which may indicate an area for further documentation improvement.
