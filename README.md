# BramblSc-Assessment - Documentation Improvements for BramblSc
This documentation contains suggestions and improvements to the existing BramblSc documentation.

## Sections Selected for Improvement:
- [README.md](https://github.com/gconnect/BramblSc-Assessment/blob/main/github-readme.md)
- [Getting Started](https://github.com/gconnect/BramblSc-Assessment/blob/main/getting-started.md)
- [Service Kit](https://github.com/gconnect/BramblSc-Assessment/blob/main/service-kit.md)
- [Troubleshooting and Documentation Navigation](https://github.com/gconnect/BramblSc-Assessment/blob/main/other-suggestions.md)
- [Terminologies](https://github.com/gconnect/BramblSc-Assessment/blob/main/teminologies.md)


## Reason for Selection:
The README.md is the first interaction point for developers. Improving it ensures better onboarding for both new and experienced users.
The Getting Started and Usage examples reduce friction for developers by showing how to use the library directly.

The service Kit section has more detailed information about the kit and implementation steps. The service kit is one of the key features of the SDK that most developers will integrate into their applications when using the BramblSc SDK.

Troubleshooting helps developers resolve common issues, improving their overall experience. 
## Summary of Changes
### README.md
- A detailed introduction and installation guide were added.
- Added a sample transaction creation example to the README.
- Provided an overview of key artifacts.

### Getting Started and Usage Examples
- Suggested a better structure
- Additional sections like introduction, prerequisite, and setup requirements
- Suggested detailed Installation guide with examples.

### Service Kit
- Suggested proper breakdown of the Service kit with helpful comments and examples
  
### Troubleshooting
- Proposed adding common issues (e.g., Scala version conflicts) to save developers time.

### Terminologies/Glossary
- Suggested adding a Glossary section for proper explanation of keywords and abbreviations.

## Challenges Faced
It was unclear how some artifacts (e.g., service kits) are intended to be used. I suggested linking to subdirectories or test files for better understanding.
I couldnâ€™t find clear usage examples for all artifacts, which may indicate an area for further documentation improvement.
